# Navigation Patterns

**Rule**: Navigation should be handled exclusively through Coordinators, not directly in Components.

**Rationale**: Centralizing navigation logic in Coordinators makes the navigation flow more maintainable and testable. It also allows for easier deep linking and navigation state restoration.

## Tab Navigation

**Rule**: Use `TabViewFlow` for tab-based navigation and implement a dedicated Tab Coordinator for each tab.

**Rationale**: This ensures proper separation of concerns and allows each tab to manage its own navigation stack independently.
